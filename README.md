# Reading Materials

This repo contains copies of publications and papers
that I have read so that I can find them again later.

I do not own the copyright to any of these.

Where reasonable, I'll maintain an index of the sources from where I
downloaded things. However, for historical reasons, a lot of these files don't
have attribution attached. 

This repository is NOT intended for distribution, but only as an archive
of things I've read. Again, I don't claim ownership over any of this.
