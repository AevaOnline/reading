<tt>OPINION</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>B. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The government defendants appeal the grant of summary<br>

judgment to the plaintiff, Professor Daniel J. Bernstein<br>

("Bernstein"), enjoining the enforcement of certain Export<br>

Administration Regulations ("EAR") that limit Bernstein's<br>

ability to distribute encryption software. We find that the<br>

EAR regulations (1) operate as a prepublication licensing<br>

scheme that burdens scientific expression, (2) vest boundless<br>

discretion in government officials, and (3) lack adequate pro-<br>

cedural safeguards. Consequently, we hold that the challenged<br>

regulations constitute a prior restraint on speech that offends<br>

the First Amendment. Although we employ a somewhat nar-<br>

rower rationale than did the district court, its judgment is<br>

accordingly affirmed.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>BACKGROUND</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>A. Facts and Procedural History</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Bernstein is currently a professor in the Department of<br>

Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at the Univer-<br>

sity of Illinois at Chicago. As a doctoral candidate at the
Uni-</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4222<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>versity of California, Berkeley, he developed an encryption<br>

method -- "a zero-delay private-key stream encryptor based<br>

upon a one-way hash function"1 -- that he dubbed "Snuffle."<br>

Bernstein described his method in two ways: in a paper con-<br>

taining analysis and mathematical equations (the "Paper") and<br>

in two computer programs written in "C," a high-level com-<br>

puter programming language ("Source Code"). Bernstein later<br>

wrote a set of instructions in English (the "Instructions")<br>

explaining how to program a computer to encrypt and decrypt<br>

data utilizing a one-way hash function, essentially translating<br>

verbatim his Source Code into prose form.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Seeking to present his work on Snuffle within the academic<br>

and scientific communities, Bernstein asked the State Depart-<br>

ment whether he needed a license to publish Snuffle in any of<br>

its various forms. The State Department responded that Snuf-<br>

fle was a munition under the International Traffic in Arms<br>

Regulations ("ITAR"), and that Bernstein would need a<br>

license to "export" the Paper, the Source Code, or the<br>

Instructions.2 There followed a protracted and unproductive<br>

series of letter communications between Bernstein and the<br>

government, wherein Bernstein unsuccessfully attempted to<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

1 The term "hash function" describes a function that transforms an
input<br>

into a unique output of fixed (and usually smaller) size that is
dependent<br>

on the input. For some purposes (e.g. error checking, digital
signatures),<br>

it is desirable that it be impossible to derive the input data given
only the<br>

hash function's output -- this type of function is known as a
"one-way</tt><br>

<tt>hash function." Hash functions have many uses in cryptography and
com-<br>

puter science, and numerous one-way hash functions are widely
known.<br>

"Zero-delay" means that Snuffle can be used for interactive
communica-<br>

tions because it encrypts and decrypts on a character-by-character
basis --<br>

the users need not complete an entire message before encrypting and
send-<br>

ing.<br>

2 In June 1995, after Bernstein initiated this suit, the State
Department<br>

clarified its earlier determination, explaining that while ITAR did
restrict<br>

the Source Code and the Instructions, it did not restrict the
Paper.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4223<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>determine the scope and application of the export regulations<br>

to Snuffle.3</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Bernstein ultimately filed this action, challenging the con-<br>

stitutionality of the ITAR regulations. The district court found<br>

that the Source Code was speech protected by the First<br>

Amendment, see Bernstein v. Department of State , 922<br>

F. Supp. 1426 (N.D. Cal. 1996) ("Bernstein I"), and subse-<br>

quently granted summary judgment to Bernstein on his First<br>

Amendment claims, holding the challenged ITAR regulations<br>

facially invalid as a prior restraint on speech, see Bernstein v.<br>

Department of State, 945 F. Supp. 1279 (N.D. Cal. 1996)<br>

("Bernstein II").</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>In December 1996, President Clinton shifted licensing<br>

authority for nonmilitary encryption commodities and tech-<br>

nologies from the State Department to the Department of<br>

Commerce. See Exec. Order No. 13,026, 61 Fed. Reg. 58,767<br>

(1996). The Department of Commerce then promulgated reg-<br>

ulations under the EAR to govern the export of encryption<br>

technology, regulations administered by the Bureau of Export<br>

Administration ("BXA"). See 61 Fed. Reg. 68,572 (1996)<br>

(codified at 15 C.F.R. Pts. 730-74). Bernstein subsequently<br>

amended his complaint to add the Department of Commerce<br>

as a defendant, advancing the same constitutional objections<br>

as he had against the State Department. The district court, fol-<br>

lowing the rationale of its earlier Bernstein &nbsp;opinions,
once<br>

again granted summary judgment in favor of Bernstein, find-<br>

ing the new EAR regulations facially invalid as a prior<br>

restraint on speech. See Bernstein v. Department of State, 974<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

3 Bernstein notes that his difficulties with the State Department are
by</tt><br>

<tt>no means unique. Declarations provided by Bernstein demonstrate
ongo-<br>

ing suppression of academic publication by the State Department
under<br>

ITAR. See Demberger Decl. (found in violation of ITAR for posting<br>

encryption program on the internet); Junger Decl. (stated that
ITAR<br>

caused him to censor publication of his work for fear of violating
the regu-<br>

lations); Zimmerman Decl. (target of a criminal investigation for
publish-<br>

ing encryption software on the internet).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4224<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>F. Supp. 1288 (N.D. Cal. 1997) ("Bernstein III"). The
district<br>

court enjoined the Commerce Department from future<br>

enforcement of the invalidated provisions, an injunction that<br>

has been stayed pending this appeal.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>B. Overview of Cryptography</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Cryptography is the science of secret writing, a science that<br>

has roots stretching back hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of<br>

years. See generally DAVID KHAN, THE CODEBREAKERS (2d ed.<br>

1996). For much of its history, cryptography has been the<br>

jealously guarded province of governments and militaries. In<br>

the past twenty years, however, the science has blossomed in<br>

the civilian sphere, driven on the one hand by dramatic theo-<br>

retical innovations within the field, and on the other by the<br>

needs of modern communication and information technolo-<br>

gies. As a result, cryptography has become a dynamic aca-<br>

demic discipline within applied mathematics. It is the<br>

cryptographer's primary task to find secure methods to<br>

encrypt messages, making them unintelligible to all except the<br>

intended recipients:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption basically involves running a
readable<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message known as "plaintext" through a
computer<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; program that translates the message according to
an<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; equation or algorithm into unreadable
"ciphertext."<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decryption is the translation back to plaintext
when<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the message is received by someone with an
appro-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priate "key."</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Bernstein III, 974 F. Supp. at 1292. The applications of<br>

encryption, however, are not limited to ensuring secrecy;<br>

encryption can also be employed to ensure data integrity,<br>

authenticate users, and facilitate nonrepudiation (e.g., linking<br>

a specific message to a specific sender). See id.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>It is, of course, encryption's secrecy applications that con-<br>

cern the government. The interception and deciphering of
for-</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4225<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>eign communications has long played an important part in our<br>

nation's national security efforts. In the words of a high-<br>

ranking State Department official:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Policies concerning the export control of
crypto-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; graphic products are based on the fact that the
prolif-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eration of such products will make it easier
for<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; foreign intelligence targets to deny the United
States<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government access to information vital to
national<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; security interests. Cryptographic products and
soft-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ware have military and intelligence
applications. As<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; demonstrated throughout history, encryption
has<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; been used to conceal foreign military
communica-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tions, on the battlefield, aboard ships and
subma-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rines, or in other military settings. Encryption
is also<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to conceal other foreign communications
that<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have foreign policy and national security
signifi-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cance for the United States. For example,
encryption<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can be used to conceal communications of
terrorists,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drug smugglers, or others intent on taking
hostile<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; action against U.S. facilities, personnel, or
security<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interests.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Lowell Decl. at 4 (reproduced in Appellant's Excerpts of<br>

Record at 97). As increasingly sophisticated and secure<br>

encryption methods are developed, the government's interest<br>

in halting or slowing the proliferation of such methods has<br>

grown keen. The EAR regulations at issue in this appeal evi-<br>

dence this interest.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>C. The EAR regulations4</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The EAR contain specific regulations to control the export<br>

of encryption software, expressly including computer source<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

4 Because the district court capably detailed the ITAR and EAR
regula-<br>

tory regimes, see Bernstein III, 974 F. Supp. at 1292-96, we present
only<br>

an overview of the relevant provisions here.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4226<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>code. Encryption software is treated differently from other<br>

software in a number of significant ways. First, the term<br>

"export" is specifically broadened5 &nbsp;with respect to
encryption<br>

software to preclude the use of the internet and other global<br>

mediums if such publication would allow passive or active<br>

access by a foreign national within the United States or any-<br>

one outside the United States. 15 C.F.R. S 734.2(b)(9)(B)(ii).6<br>

Second, the regulations governing the export of nonencryp-<br>

tion software provide for several exceptions that are not appli-<br>

cable to encryption software.7 In addition, although printed<br>

materials containing encryption source code are not subject to<br>

EAR regulation, the same materials made available on<br>

machine-readable media, such as floppy disk or CD-ROM,<br>

are covered. 15 C.F.R. S 734.3(b), Note to Paragraphs (b)(2)<br>

&amp; (b)(3). The government, moreover, has reserved the right<br>

to restrict source code in printed form that may be easily<br>

"scanned," thus creating some ambiguity as to whether<br>

_________________________________________________________________</tt><br>

<tt>5 "Export," even as applied to software generally, is defined
quite<br>

broadly to include any release, including oral exchanges of
information<br>

and visual inspections, in a foreign country or to a foreign national
within<br>

the United States. 15 C.F.R. S 734.2(b)(2) &amp; (3).<br>

6 Specifically, 15 C.F.R. S 734.2(b)(9)(B)(ii) provides that
"export"<br>

includes:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; downloading or causing the downloading of,
such software to<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; locations (including electronic bulletin boards,
Internet file trans-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fer protocol, and World Wide Web sites) outside
the U.S., or<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making such software available for transfer
outside the United<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; States, over wire, cable, radio,
electromagnetic, photo-optical,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; photoelectric or other comparable communications
facilities<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accessible to persons outside the United States,
including trans-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet
file transfer protocol<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and World Wide Web sites, unless the person
making the soft-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ware available takes precautions adequate to
prevent unautho-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rized transfer of such code outside the United
States.<br>

7 These exceptions allow for export of software that is publicly
avail-<br>

able, 15 C.F.R. S 734.7(c); results from fundamental research or is
educa-<br>

tional, 15 C.F.R. SS 734.3(b)(3), 734.8, 734.9; is already available
from<br>

foreign sources, 15 C.F.R. S 768.1(b); or contains only a de minimis
quan-</tt><br>

<tt>tity of domestically-derived content, 15 C.F.R.S
734.4(b)(2).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4227<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>printed publications are necessarily exempt from licensing.<br>

See 61 Fed. Reg. 68,575 (1996).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>If encryption software falls within the ambit of the relevant<br>

EAR provisions, the "export" of such software requires a pre-<br>

publication license. When a prepublication license is<br>

requested, the relevant agencies undertake a "case-by-case"<br>

analysis to determine if the export is "consistent with U.S.<br>

national security and foreign policy interests." 15 C.F.R.<br>

S 742.15(b). All applications must be "resolved or referred to<br>

the President no later than 90 days" from the date an applica-<br>

tion is entered into the BXA's electronic license processing<br>

system. 15 C.F.R. S 750.4(a). There is no time limit, however,<br>

that applies once an application is referred to the President.<br>

Although the regulations do provide for an internal adminis-<br>

trative appeal procedure, such appeals are governed only by<br>

the exhortation that they be completed "within a reasonable<br>

time." 15 C.F.R. S 756.2(c)(1). Final administrative decisions<br>

are not subject to judicial review. 15 C.F.R. S 756.2(c)(2).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>DISCUSSION</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>I. Prior Restraint</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The parties and amici urge a number of theories on us. We<br>

limit our attention here, for the most part, to only one:<br>

whether the EAR restrictions on the export of encryption soft-<br>

ware in source code form constitute a prior restraint in viola-<br>

tion of the First Amendment. We review de novo &nbsp;the district<br>

court's affirmative answer to this question. See Roulette v.<br>

Seattle, 97 F.3d 300, 302 (9th Cir. 1996).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[1] It is axiomatic that "prior restraints on speech and
publi-<br>

cation are the most serious and least tolerable infringement on<br>

First Amendment rights." Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427<br>

U.S. 539, 559 (1976). Indeed, the Supreme Court has opined<br>

that "it is the chief purpose of the [First Amendment] guar-<br>

anty to prevent previous restraints upon publication." Near
v.</tt><br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 713 (1931). Accordingly, "[a]ny<br>

prior restraint on expression comes . . . with a`heavy pre-<br>

sumption' against its constitutional validity." Organization<br>

for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419 (1971). At the<br>

same time, the Supreme Court has cautioned that"[t]he<br>

phrase `prior restraint' is not a self-wielding sword. Nor can<br>

it serve as a talismanic test." Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown,<br>

354 U.S. 436, 441 (1957). We accordingly turn from"[t]he<br>

generalization that prior restraint is particularly obnoxious" to<br>

a "more particularistic analysis." Id. at 442.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[2] The Supreme Court has treated licensing schemes that<br>

act as prior restraints on speech with suspicion because such<br>

restraints run the twin risks of encouraging self-censorship<br>

and concealing illegitimate abuses of censorial power. See<br>

Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750, 759<br>

(1988). As a result, "even if the government may constitution-<br>

ally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular man-<br>

ner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining<br>

a license or permit from a government official in that offi-<br>

cial's boundless discretion." Id. at 764 (emphasis in original).<br>

We follow the lead of the Supreme Court and divide the<br>

appropriate analysis into two parts. The threshold question is<br>

whether Bernstein is entitled to bring a facial challenge<br>

against the EAR regulations. See id. at 755. If he is so enti-<br>

tled, we proceed to the second question: whether the regula-<br>

tions constitute an impermissible prior restraint on speech.<br>

See id. at 769.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>A. Is Bernstein entitled to bring a facial attack?</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[3] A licensing regime is always subject to facial challenge8<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

8 In using the term "facial challenge" in the prior restraint
context, the<br>

Supreme Court has meant two distinct things. First, if entitled to
bring a<br>

facial challenge, a plaintiff need not apply for a license before
challenging<br>

the licensing regime. See Lakewood, 380 U.S. at 755-56. This is a
question<br>

of standing. Second, a litigant challenging an enactment on its face
cham-</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4229<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>as a prior restraint where it "gives a government official or<br>

agency substantial power to discriminate based on the content<br>

or viewpoint of speech by suppressing disfavored speech or<br>

disliked speakers," and has "a close enough nexus to expres-<br>

sion, or to conduct commonly associated with expression, to<br>

pose a real and substantial threat of . . . censorship risks."
Id.<br>

at 759.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[4] The EAR regulations at issue plainly satisfy the first<br>

requirement -- "the determination of who may speak and<br>

who may not is left to the unbridled discretion of a govern-<br>

ment official." Id. at 763. BXA administrators are empowered<br>

to deny licenses whenever export might be inconsistent with<br>

"U.S. national security and foreign policy interests." 15<br>

C.F.R. S 742.15(b). No more specific guidance is provided.<br>

Obviously, this constraint on official discretion is little
better<br>

than no constraint at all. See Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 769-70<br>

(a standard requiring that license denial be in the "public<br>

interest" is an "illusory" standard that "renders the guarantee<br>

against censorship little more than a high-sounding ideal.").<br>

The government's assurances that BXA administrators will<br>

not, in fact, discriminate on the basis of content are beside the<br>

point. See id. at 770 (presumption that official will act in good<br>

faith "is the very presumption that the doctrine forbidding<br>

unbridled discretion disallows."). After all,"the mere exis-</tt><br>

<tt>tence of the licensor's unfettered discretion, coupled with
the<br>

power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring<br>

their own speech, even if the discretion and power are never<br>

actually abused." Id. at 757.<br>

pions the rights of those not before the court and thus may attack
the stat-<br>

ute "whether or not his conduct could be proscribed by a properly
drawn<br>

statute." Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 56 (1965); see also
Secre-<br>

tary of State of Md. v. J. H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 957
(1984);<br>

Roulette, 97 F.3d at 303 n.3. This goes to the scope of the
constitutional<br>

challenge.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4230<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The more difficult issue arises in relation to the second<br>

requirement -- that the challenged regulations exhibit "a<br>

close enough nexus to expression." We are called on to deter-<br>

mine whether encryption source code is expression for First<br>

Amendment purposes.9</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>We begin by explaining what source code is.10 "Source<br>

code," at least as currently understood by computer program-<br>

mers, refers to the text of a program written in a "high-level"<br>

programming language, such as "PASCAL" or "C." The dis-<br>

tinguishing feature of source code is that it is meant to be read<br>

and understood by humans and that it can be used to express<br>

an idea or a method. A computer, in fact, can make no direct<br>

use of source code until it has been translated ("compiled")<br>

into a "low-level" or "machine" language, resulting in<br>

computer-executable "object code." That source code is<br>

meant for human eyes and understanding, however, does not<br>

mean that an untutored layperson can understand it. Because<br>

source code is destined for the maw of an automated, ruth-<br>

lessly literal translator -- the compiler -- a programmer must<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

9 As an initial matter, we note that the fact that the regulations
reach only<br>

"exports" does not reduce the burden on Bernstein's First
Amendment</tt><br>

<tt>rights. It is Bernstein's right to speak, not the rights of
foreign listeners to<br>

hear, that we are concerned with here. The government does not argue,
nor<br>

could it, that being cut off from a foreign audience, as
distinguished from<br>

a domestic one, does not implicate First Amendment concerns. See
Bull-<br>

frog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 F.2d 502, 509 n.9 (9th Cir. 1988). In
addi-<br>

tion, because the regulations define "export" to include the use of
internet<br>

fora that may be accessible by foreign nationals, as well as domestic
com-<br>

munications with foreign nationals, we think it plain that the
regulations<br>

potentially limit Bernstein's freedom of speech in a variety of both
domes-<br>

tic and foreign contexts. See Reno v. American Civ. Lib. Union, 117
S. Ct.<br>

2329, 2348-49 (1997) (rejecting government argument that restriction
of<br>

expression on the internet is justified because ample alternative
channels<br>

of communication exist).<br>

10 In undertaking this task, we are mindful that computer
technology,<br>

and the lexicon of terms that accompanies it, is changing rapidly.
Never-</tt><br>

<tt>theless, because the regulations speak in terms of "source code,"
we prem-<br>

ise our discussion on the meaning commonly ascribed to this term by
the<br>

programming community.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4231<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>follow stringent grammatical, syntactical, formatting, and<br>

punctuation conventions. As a result, only those trained in<br>

programming can easily understand source code.11</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Also important for our purposes is an understanding of how<br>

source code is used in the field of cryptography. Bernstein has<br>

submitted numerous declarations from cryptographers and<br>

computer programmers explaining that cryptographic ideas<br>

and algorithms are conveniently expressed in source code.12<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

11 It must be emphasized, however, that source code is merely text,
albeit<br>

text that conforms to stringent formatting and punctuation
requirements.<br>

For example, the following is an excerpt from Bernstein's Snuffle
source<br>

code:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>for (; ;)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uch = gtchr();<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (!(n &amp; 31))<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (i = 0; i64;
i++)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;l [ ctr[i] ] = k[i] + h[n - 64 + i]<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hash512 (wm, wl,
level, 8);<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>As source code goes, Snuffle is quite compact; the entirety of
the Snuffle<br>

source code occupies fewer than four printed pages.<br>

12 Source code's power to convey algorithmic information is
illustrated<br>

by the declaration of MIT Professor Harold Abelson:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The square root of a number X is the
number Y such that Y<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; times Y equals X. This is declarative knowledge.
It tells us some-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thing about square roots. But it doesn't tell us
how to find a<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; square root.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In contrast, consider the following
ancient algorithm, attributed<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to Heron of Alexandria, for approximating square
roots:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To approximate the square root of a
positive number X,</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Make a guess for the square root of
X.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Compute an improved guess as the average
of the guess<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and X divided by the guess.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Keep improving the guess until it is good
enough.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4232<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>That this should be so is, on reflection, not surprising. As<br>

noted earlier, the chief task for cryptographers is the develop-<br>

ment of secure methods of encryption. While the articulation<br>

of such a system in layman's English or in general mathemati-<br>

cal terms may be useful, the devil is, at least for cryptogra-<br>

phers, often in the algorithmic details. By utilizing source<br>

code, a cryptographer can express algorithmic ideas with pre-<br>

cision and methodological rigor that is otherwise difficult to<br>

achieve. This has the added benefit of facilitating peer review<br>

-- by compiling the source code, a cryptographer can create<br>

a working model subject to rigorous security tests. The need<br>

for precisely articulated hypotheses and formal empirical test-<br>

ing, of course, is not unique to the science of cryptography;<br>

it appears, however, that in this field, source code is the pre-<br>

ferred means to these ends.<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heron's method doesn't say anything about
what square roots</tt><br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are, but it does say how to approximate
them. This is a piece of<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imperative "how to" knowledge.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Computer science is in the business of
formalizing imperative<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowledge -- developing formal notations and
ways to reason<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and talk about methodology. Here is Heron's
method formalized<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as a procedure in the notation of the Lisp
computer language:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(define (sqrtx)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(define (good-enough? guess)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;((abs (- (square guess) x))
tolerance))</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(define (improve guess)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(average guess (/ x
guess)))</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(define (try guess)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(if (good-enough?
guess)</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; guess</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (try (improve
guess))))</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(try 1))</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4233<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[5] Thus, cryptographers use source code to express their<br>

scientific ideas in much the same way that mathematicians<br>

use equations or economists use graphs. Of course, both<br>

mathematical equations and graphs are used in other fields for<br>

many purposes, not all of which are expressive. But mathema-<br>

ticians and economists have adopted these modes of expres-<br>

sion in order to facilitate the precise and rigorous expression<br>

of complex scientific ideas.13 Similarly, the undisputed record<br>

here makes it clear that cryptographers utilize source code in<br>

the same fashion.14</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[6] In light of these considerations, we conclude that<br>

encryption software, in its source code form15 and as<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

13 We are reminded of at least one occasion in which a judicial
thinker<br>

resorted to a mathematical equation to express a legal principle.
See<br>

United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169, 173 (2d Cir.
1947)<br>

(Judge Hand's famous BPL formula to determine "when the absence
of<br>

a bargee or other attendant will make the owner of the barge liable
for<br>

injuries to other vessels if she breaks away from her
moorings.").<br>

14 Bernstein's Snuffle, in fact, provides an illustration of this
point. By<br>

developing Snuffle, Bernstein was attempting to demonstrate that a
one-<br>

way hash function could be employed as the heart of an encryption<br>

method. The Snuffle source code, as submitted by Bernstein to the
State<br>

Department, was meant as an expression of how this might be
accom-<br>

plished. The Source Code was plainly not intended as a completed
encryp-<br>

tion product, as demonstrated by the fact that it was incomplete and
not</tt><br>

<tt>in a form suitable for final compiling. The Source Code, in fact,
omits the<br>

hash function entirely -- until combined with such a function and
com-<br>

piled, Snuffle is incapable of performing encryption functions at
all.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Snuffle was also intended, in part, as political expression.
Bernstein dis-<br>

covered that the ITAR regulations controlled encryption exports, but
not<br>

one-way hash functions. Because he believed that an encryption
system<br>

could easily be fashioned from any of a number of publicly-available
one-<br>

way hash functions, he viewed the distinction made by the ITAR
regula-<br>

tions as absurd. To illustrate his point, Bernstein developed
Snuffle, which<br>

is an encryption system built around a one-way hash function.<br>

15 We express no opinion regarding whether object code manifests
a<br>

"close enough nexus to expression" to warrant application of the
prior<br>

restraint doctrine. Bernstein's Snuffle did not involve object code,
nor<br>

does the record contain any information regarding expressive uses
of<br>

object code in the field of cryptography.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4234<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>employed by those in the field of cryptography, must be<br>

viewed as expressive for First Amendment purposes, and thus<br>

is entitled to the protections of the prior restraint doctrine.
If<br>

the government required that mathematicians obtain a pre-<br>

publication license prior to publishing material that included<br>

mathematical equations, we have no doubt that such a regime<br>

would be subject to scrutiny as a prior restraint. The availabil-<br>

ity of alternate means of expression, moreover, does not<br>

diminish the censorial power of such a restraint -- that Adam<br>

Smith wrote Wealth of Nations without resorting to equations<br>

or graphs surely would not justify governmental prepublica-<br>

tion review of economics literature that contain these modes<br>

of expression.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The government, in fact, does not seriously dispute that<br>

source code is used by cryptographers for expressive pur-<br>

poses. Rather, the government maintains that source code is<br>

different from other forms of expression (such as blueprints,<br>

recipes, and "how-to" manuals) because it can be used to con-<br>

trol directly the operation of a computer without conveying<br>

information to the user. In the government's view, by target-<br>

ing this unique functional aspect of source code, rather than<br>

the content of the ideas that may be expressed therein, the<br>

export regulations manage to skirt entirely the concerns of the<br>

First Amendment. This argument is flawed for at least two<br>

reasons.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[7] First, it is not at all obvious that the government's
view<br>

reflects a proper understanding of source code. As noted ear-<br>

lier, the distinguishing feature of source code is that it is<br>

meant to be read and understood by humans, and that it<br>

cannot be used to control directly the functioning of a com-<br>

puter. While source code, when properly prepared, can be eas-<br>

ily compiled into object code by a user, ignoring the<br>

distinction between source and object code obscures the<br>

important fact that source code is not meant solely for the<br>

computer, but is rather written in a language intended also for<br>

human analysis and understanding.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4235<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[8] Second, and more importantly, the government's argu-<br>

ment, distilled to its essence, suggests that even one drop of<br>

"direct functionality" overwhelms any constitutional protec-<br>

tions that expression might otherwise enjoy. This cannot be so.16<br>

The distinction urged on us by the government would prove<br>

too much in this era of rapidly evolving computer capabilities.<br>

The fact that computers will soon be able to respond directly<br>

to spoken commands, for example, should not confer on the<br>

government the unfettered power to impose prior restraints on<br>

speech in an effort to control its "functional " aspects. The<br>

First Amendment is concerned with expression, and we reject<br>

the notion that the admixture of functionality necessarily puts<br>

expression beyond the protections of the Constitution.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[9] The government also contends that the challenged regu-<br>

lations are immune from prior restraint analysis because they<br>

are "laws of general application" rather than being "directed<br>

narrowly and specifically at expression." Lakewood, 486 U.S.<br>

at 760-61. We cannot agree. Because we conclude that source<br>

code is utilized by those in the cryptography field as a means<br>

of expression, and because the regulations apply to encryption<br>

source code, it necessarily follows that the regulations burden<br>

a particular form of expression directly.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[10] The Supreme Court in Lakewood &nbsp;explored what it<br>

means to be a "law of general application" for prior restraint<br>

purposes. In that case, the Court cited a law requiring building<br>

permits as a "law of general application" that would not be<br>

subject to a facial attack as a prior restraint, reasoning that<br>

such a law carried "little danger of censorship, " even if it<br>

could be used to retaliate against a disfavored newspaper<br>

seeking to build a printing plant. Id. at 761. In the Court's<br>

view, "such laws provide too blunt a censorship instrument to<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

16 If it were, we would have expected the Supreme Court to start and
end<br>

its analysis of David Paul O'Brien's burning of his draft card with
an<br>

inquiry into whether he was kept warm by the ensuing flames. See
United<br>

States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4236<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>warrant judicial intervention prior to an allegation of
actual<br>

misuse." Id. Unlike a building permit ordinance, which would<br>

afford government officials only intermittent and unpredict-<br>

able opportunities to exercise unrestrained discretion over<br>

expression, the challenged EAR regulations explicitly apply<br>

to expression and place scientific expression under the cen-<br>

sor's eye on a regular basis. In fact, there is ample evidence<br>

in the record establishing that some in the cryptography field<br>

have already begun censoring themselves, for fear that their<br>

statements might influence the disposition of future licensing<br>

applications. See, e.g., NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, CRYP-<br>

TOGRAPHY'S ROLE IN SECURING THE INFORMATION SOCIETY 158<br>

(1996) ("Vendors contended that since they are effectively at<br>

the mercy of the export control regulators, they have consider-<br>

able incentive to suppress any public expression of dissatis-<br>

faction with the current process."). In these circumstances, we<br>

cannot conclude that the export control regime at issue is a</tt><br>

<tt>"law of general application" immune from prior restraint<br>

analysis.17<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

17 The government also argues that the EAR regulations are "laws
of<br>

general application" because they are not purposefully aimed at
suppress-<br>

ing any particular ideas that may be expressed in source code.
With<br>

respect to this contention, the panel (including the dissenter) agree
that the<br>

purpose of the regulations is irrelevant to prior restraint analysis.
It is clear<br>

that a prior restraint analysis applies equally to content-neutral or
content-<br>

based enactments. See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 223
(1990)<br>

(plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("Because we conclude that the
city's<br>

licensing scheme lacks adequate procedural safeguards, we do not
reach<br>

. . . whether the ordinance is properly viewed as a content-neutral
time,<br>

place, and manner restriction. . . ."); Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 764
("[E]ven<br>

if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral
prohibi-<br>

tions on a particular manner of speech, it may not &nbsp;condition
that speech</tt><br>

<tt>on obtaining a license or permit from a government official in
that offi-<br>

cial's boundless discretion.") (emphasis in original). Indeed, where
unbri-<br>

dled discretion is vested in a governmental official, it is difficult
to know<br>

whether a licensing regime is content-based or content-neutral.
Accord-<br>

ingly, the government's purpose in censoring encryption source code
is,<br>

at this stage of our First Amendment inquiry, beside the point. In
other<br>

words, a prepublication licensing regime that has a chilling and
censorial<br>

effect on expression is properly subject to facial attack as a prior
restraint,</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4237<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[11] Because the prepublication licensing scheme chal-<br>

lenged here vests unbridled discretion in government officials,<br>

and because it directly jeopardizes scientific expression, we<br>

are satisfied that Bernstein may properly bring a facial chal-<br>

lenge against the regulations.18 We accordingly turn to the<br>

merits.<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

whatever the purpose behind its enactment. See Lakewood, 486 U.S.
at<br>

759 (upholding facial attack against newsrack ordinance because of
censo-<br>

rial effects, without discussing governmental purpose for enacting
the<br>

ordinance).<br>

18 It is at this juncture that we part ways with the dissent. The
dissent<br>

concedes that source code can be expressive. Nevertheless, the
dissent<br>

contends that Bernstein is not entitled to bring a facial attack
against the<br>

EAR regulation. This argument, it seems to us, is based on two
founda-<br>

tions.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>First, the dissent conceives of the exchange of source code among
sci-<br>

entists as "conduct." We disagree. The source code at issue here is
text<br>

intended for human understanding, albeit in a specialized language.
To say<br>

that the "export" of this text is "conduct " for First Amendment
purposes,<br>

rather than straightforward scientific "expression," is to call into
question<br>

all distribution and circulation of scientific texts that communicate
ideas<br>

by using specialized languages. Of course, source code may be
functional<br>

as well as expressive. We are not persuaded, however, that that fact
trans-<br>

mogrifies the distribution of scientific texts from "expression"
into<br>

"conduct" deserving of diminished First Amendment
protection.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Having cast the question as one relating to "conduct," the
dissent then<br>

takes a second step. Drawing from Lakeside, the dissent asks whether
the<br>

"conduct" -- the exchange of cryptographic source code -- is
"commonly<br>

associated with expression." This question the dissent answers in the
nega-<br>

tive; in other words, the dissent concludes that source code is not
used<br>

expressively often enough. We find this conclusion somewhat
perplexing,<br>

as there is nothing in the record to support it. Bernstein has
introduced<br>

extensive expert evidence to support his contention that source code
is fre-<br>

quently used for expressive purposes. The government, however,
has<br>

failed to introduce anything into the record to rebut this evidence.
In fact,<br>

the government has made it clear that it means to control the export
of<br>

source code no matter how commonly associated it may be with<br>

expresssion: "Whatever ideas may be reflected in the software, or
the<br>

intent of the exporter to convey ideas, the NSA recommends that
encryp-<br>

tion software be controlled for export solely on the basis of what it
does.</tt><br>

<tt>B. Are the regulations an impermissible prior restraint?</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[12] "[T]he protection even as to previous restraint is not<br>

absolutely unlimited." Near, 283 U.S. at 716. The Supreme<br>

Court has suggested that the "heavy presumption " against<br>

prior restraints may be overcome where official discretion is<br>

bounded by stringent procedural safeguards. See FW/PBS,<br>

493 U.S. at 227 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.);<br>

Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58-59 (1965); Kingsley<br>

Books, 354 U.S. at 442-43; 11126 Baltimore Blvd. v. Prince<br>

George's County, 58 F.3d 988, 995 (4th Cir. 1995) (en banc).<br>

As our analysis above suggests, the challenged regulations do<br>

not qualify for this First Amendment safe harbor. 19 In<br>

Freedman v. Maryland, the Supreme Court set out three fac-<br>

tors for determining the validity of licensing schemes that<br>

impose a prior restraint on speech: (1) any restraint must be<br>

for a specified brief period of time; (2) there must be expedi-<br>

tious judicial review; and (3) the censor must bear the burden<br>

of going to court to suppress the speech in question and must<br>

_________________________________________________________________</tt><br>

<tt>19 The Supreme Court has also suggested that the presumption
against<br>

prior restraints may be overcome where publication would directly
and<br>

imminently imperil national security. See New York Times Co. v.
United<br>

States, 403 U.S. 713, 730 (1971) (Stewart, J., joined by White, J.,
concur-<br>

ring); Near, 283 U.S. at 716; see also United States v. The
Progressive,<br>

Inc., 467 F. Supp. 990, 992 (W.D. Wisc. 1979). In order to justify a
prior<br>

restraint on national security grounds, the government must prove the
pub-<br>

lication would "surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable
damage<br>

to our Nation or its people." New York Times, 403 U.S. at 730
(Stewart,<br>

J., joined by White, J., concurring); see also id. at 726-27
(Brennan, J.,<br>

concurring) (finding that national security is a sufficient interest
only<br>

where there is "governmental allegation and proof that publication
must<br>

inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an
event kin-<br>

dred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea"); Burch
v.</tt><br>

<tt>Baker, 861 F.2d 1149, 1155 (9th Cir. 1988) ("Prior restraints are
permissi-<br>

ble in only the rarest of circumstances, such as imminent threat to
national<br>

security.").</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The government does not argue that the prior restraint at issue
here falls<br>

within the extremely narrow class of cases where publication
would<br>

directly and immediately imperil national security.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>bear the burden of proof.20 See 380 U.S. at 58-60. The
district<br>

court found that the procedural protections provided by the<br>

EAR regulations are "woefully inadequate" when measured<br>

against these requirements. Bernstein III, 974 F. Supp. at<br>

1308. We agree.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[13] Although the regulations require that license applica-<br>

tions be resolved or referred to the President within 90 days,<br>

see 15 C.F.R. S 750.4(a), there is no time limit once an appli-<br>

cation is referred to the President. Thus, the 90-day limit can<br>

be rendered meaningless by referral. Moreover, if the license<br>

application is denied, no firm time limit governs the internal<br>

appeals process. See 15 C.F.R. S 756.2(c)(1) (Under Secretary<br>

"shall decide an appeal within a reasonable time after receipt<br>

of the appeal."). Accordingly, the EAR regulations do not sat-<br>

isfy the first Freedman requirement that a licensing decision<br>

be made within a reasonably short, specified period of time.<br>

See FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 226 (finding that "a prior restraint<br>

that fails to place time limits on the time within which the<br>

decisionmaker must issue the license is impermissible"); Riley<br>

v. National Fed. of the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 802 (1988)<br>

(licensing scheme that permits "delay without limit" is imper-<br>

missible); Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., 445 U.S. 308,</tt><br>

<tt>315-17 (1980) (prior restraint of indefinite duration is
imper-<br>

missible). The EAR regulatory regime further offends<br>

Freedman's procedural requirements insofar as it denies a dis-<br>

appointed applicant the opportunity for judicial review.21 See<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

20 Whether all three Freedman &nbsp;factors apply to all prior
restraints is the<br>

subject of dispute. Compare FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 229-30 (plurality
opin-<br>

ion of O'Connor, J.) (finding the government does not bear the burden
of<br>

going to court to defend its licensing requirement where restrained
speak-<br>

ers are likely to challenge the restraint in court) with id. at 239
(Brennan,<br>

J., concurring in judgment) ("We have never suggested that our
insistence<br>

on Freedman procedures might vary with the particular facts of the
prior<br>

restraint before us."). Because we conclude that the EAR regulations
fail<br>

Freedman's first two procedural requirements, we need not reach the
issue<br>

of whether the third Freedman factor applies in this case.</tt><br>

<tt>21 As noted earlier, the BXA enjoys essentially unbounded
discretion<br>

under the EAR regulations in administering the license process.

<br>

<tt>15 C.F.R. S 756.2(c)(2); FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 229 (plurality<br>

opinion of O'Connor, J.) (finding failure to provide "prompt"<br>

judicial review violates Freedman); Freedman, 380 U.S. at 59<br>

(licensing procedure must assure a prompt final judicial deci-<br>

sion).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>[14] We conclude that the challenged regulations allow the<br>

government to restrain speech indefinitely with no clear<br>

criteria for review. As a result, Bernstein and other scientists<br>

have been effectively chilled from engaging in valuable scien-<br>

tific expression. Bernstein's experience itself demonstrates<br>

the enormous uncertainty that exists over the scope of the reg-<br>

ulations and the potential for the chilling of scientific expres-<br>

sion. In short, because the challenged regulations grant<br>

boundless discretion to government officials, and because<br>

they lack the required procedural protections set forth in<br>

Freedman, we find that they operate as an unconstitutional<br>

prior restraint on speech.22 See Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 769-<br>

772 (holding that newsrack licensing ordinance was an imper-<br>

missible prior restraint because it conferred unbounded dis-<br>

cretion and lacked adequate procedural safeguards).<br>

_________________________________________________________________<br>

ingly, even if the challenged regulations provided for judicial
review, the</tt><br>

<tt>lack of explicit limits on the decisionmaker's discretion would
likely make<br>

such review meaningless. In this sense, the presence of unbounded
discre-<br>

tion itself may be considered fatal for purposes of prior restraint
review.<br>

See Lakewood, 486 U.S. at 769-70 (striking down a licensing
scheme<br>

where the mayor could merely claim that the license" `is not in the
public<br>

interest' when denying a permit application").</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>22 Our conclusion relating to the Source Code also resolves the
status of<br>

the regulations as applied to the Instructions. Because the
Instructions are<br>

essentially a translation of the Source Code into English, they are,
if any-<br>

thing, nearer the heartland of the First Amendment. Consequently, to
the<br>

extent the challenged regulations are unconstitutional as applied to
the<br>

Source Code, they necessarily are unconstitutional as applied to
the<br>

Instructions.</tt><br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>C. Concluding comments.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>We emphasize the narrowness of our First Amendment<br>

holding. We do not hold that all software is expressive. Much<br>

of it surely is not. Nor need we resolve whether the chal-<br>

lenged regulations constitute content-based restrictions, sub-<br>

ject to the strictest constitutional scrutiny, or whether they
are,<br>

instead, content-neutral restrictions meriting less exacting<br>

scrutiny. We hold merely that because the prepublication<br>

licensing regime challenged here applies directly to scientific<br>

expression, vests boundless discretion in government offi-<br>

cials, and lacks adequate procedural safeguards, it constitutes<br>

an impermissible prior restraint on speech.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>We will, however, comment on two issues that are<br>

entwined with the underlying merits of Bernstein's constitu-<br>

tional claims. First, we note that insofar as the EAR regula-<br>

tions on encryption software were intended to slow the spread<br>

of secure encryption methods to foreign nations, the govern-<br>

ment is intentionally retarding the progress of the flourishing<br>

science of cryptography. To the extent the government's<br>

efforts are aimed at interdicting the flow of scientific ideas<br>

(whether expressed in source code or otherwise), as distin-<br>

guished from encryption products, these efforts would appear<br>

to strike deep into the heartland of the First Amendment. In<br>

this regard, the EAR regulations are very different from<br>

content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions that may<br>

have an incidental effect on expression while aiming at sec-<br>

ondary effects.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Second, we note that the government's efforts to regulate<br>

and control the spread of knowledge relating to encryption<br>

may implicate more than the First Amendment rights of cryp-<br>

tographers. In this increasingly electronic age, we are all<br>

required in our everyday lives to rely on modern technology<br>

to communicate with one another. This reliance on electronic<br>

communication, however, has brought with it a dramatic dim-<br>

inution in our ability to communicate privately. Cellular</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4242<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>phones are subject to monitoring, email is easily
intercepted,<br>

and transactions over the internet are often less than secure.<br>

Something as commonplace as furnishing our credit card<br>

number, social security number, or bank account number puts<br>

each of us at risk. Moreover, when we employ electronic<br>

methods of communication, we often leave electronic<br>

"fingerprints" behind, fingerprints that can be traced back to<br>

us. Whether we are surveilled by our government, by crimi-<br>

nals, or by our neighbors, it is fair to say that never has our<br>

ability to shield our affairs from prying eyes been at such a<br>

low ebb. The availability and use of secure encryption may<br>

offer an opportunity to reclaim some portion of the privacy<br>

we have lost. Government efforts to control encryption thus<br>

may well implicate not only the First Amendment rights of<br>

cryptographers intent on pushing the boundaries of their sci-<br>

ence, but also the constitutional rights of each of us as poten-<br>

tial recipients of encryption's bounty. Viewed from this<br>

perspective, the government's efforts to retard progress in</tt><br>

<tt>cryptography may implicate the Fourth Amendment, as well<br>

as the right to speak anonymously, see McIntyre v. Ohio Elec-<br>

tions Comm'n, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1524 (1995) , the right against<br>

compelled speech, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714<br>

(1977), and the right to informational privacy, see Whalen v.<br>

Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977). While we leave for<br>

another day the resolution of these difficult issues, it is
impor-<br>

tant to point out that Bernstein's is a suit not merely concern-<br>

ing a small group of scientists laboring in an esoteric field,
but<br>

also touches on the public interest broadly defined.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>II. Scope of Declaratory Relief</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The government also challenges the scope of the declara-<br>

tory relief granted by the district court. The government<br>

argues that the relief provided is invalid in two respects: (1)<br>

that the relief extends to encryption object code and encryp-<br>

tion commodities; (2) that the relief extends to encryption<br>

technology. The district held that</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Export Administration Regulations, 15
C.F.R. pt.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 730 et seq. (1997) and all rules, policies and
prac-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tices promulgated or pursued thereunder insofar
as<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they apply to or require licensing for
encryption and<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; decryption software and related devices and
technol-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ogy are in violation of the First Amendment on
the<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; grounds of prior restraint and are, therefore,
uncon-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stitutional as discussed above, and shall not
be<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applied to plaintiff's publishing of such
items,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; including scientific papers, algorithms or
computer<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; programs.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Bernstein III, 974 F. Supp. at 1310. We review the district<br>

court's grant of declaratory relief de novo. See Crawford v.<br>

Lungren, 96 F.3d 380, 384 (9th Cir. 1996); Ablang v. Reno,<br>

52 F.3d 801, 803 (9th Cir. 1995).</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>This inquiry leads us into the uncertain jurisprudence of<br>

"severability." See generally John Copeland Nagle,<br>

Severability, 72 N.C. L. REV. 203 (1993). The general princi-<br>

ple is clear: "[A] court should refrain from invalidating more<br>

of [a] statute than is necessary . . . . `[W]henever an act of<br>

Congress contains unobjectionable provisions separable from<br>

those found to be unconstitutional, it is the duty of this court<br>

to so declare, and to maintain the act in so far as it is valid.'
"<br>

Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987)<br>

(quoting Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 652 (1984)); see<br>

also National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Miller , 10 F.3d 633,<br>

640 (9th Cir. 1993). The applicable legal standard has also<br>

been oft repeated: "[u]nless it is evident that the Legislature<br>

would not have enacted those provisions which are within its<br>

power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part<br>

may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law."<br>

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 108 (1976) (per curiam);
accord</tt><br>

<tt>NCAA v. Miller, 10 F.3d at 640. Thus, in the general case,<br>

severability analysis properly focuses on legislative intent.<br>

See Alaska Airlines, Inc., 480 U.S. at 685.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4244<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>This case, however, is not the general case. First, the chal-<br>

lenged enactment here is a regulation, rather than a statute. As<br>

a result, we cannot look to the usual public sources to deter-<br>

mine the intentions of the drafters. Nevertheless, we agree<br>

with the government that the EAR regulations can be concep-<br>

tually severed into component parts governing commodities,<br>

software, and technology. We also assume that the Depart-<br>

ment of Commerce, even if barred from imposing prepublica-<br>

tion licensing on encryption source code, would have enacted<br>

regulations controlling the export of encryption commodities,<br>

object code, and technology.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>But while the district court may have erred in treating soft-<br>

ware and commodities as the same item, the integrated struc-<br>

ture of the regulations does not permit us to sever the various<br>

provisions in the manner requested by the government. To<br>

sever the unconstitutional portion of the regulations, we<br>

would have to line edit individual sections, deleting or modi-<br>

fying the definition of "software" while retaining "commod-<br>

ities" and "technology." We would then have to redefine gen-<br>

eral terms such as "items" which refer collectively to com-<br>

modities, software, and technology. We have neither the<br>

power nor the capacity to engage in line by line revisions of<br>

the challenged regulations or to redefine terms within the reg-<br>

ulations. See Hill v. Wallace, 259 U.S. 44, 70-71 (1922);<br>

American Booksellers Ass'n v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 332-33<br>

(7th Cir. 1985). To do so would be to improperly invade the<br>

province reserved to the Executive. Accordingly, we affirm<br>

the district court's grant of declaratory relief.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>CONCLUSION</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Because the prepublication licensing regime challenged by<br>

Bernstein applies directly to scientific expression, vests<br>

boundless discretion in government officials, and lacks ade-<br>

quate procedural safeguards, we hold that it constitutes an<br>

impermissible prior restraint on speech. We decline the invita-<br>

tion to line edit the regulations in an attempt to rescue
them</tt><br>

<tt>BRIGHT, Circuit Judge, separately concurring.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>I join Judge Fletcher's opinion. I do so because the speech<br>

aspects of encryption source code represent communication<br>

between computer programmers. I do, however, recognize the<br>

validity of Judge Nelson's view that encryption source code<br>

also has the functional purpose of controlling computers and<br>

in that regard does not command protection under the First<br>

Amendment. The importance of this case suggests that it may<br>

be appropriate for review by the United States Supreme<br>

Court.</tt><br>

<br>

<br>

<tt>T.G. NELSON, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Bernstein was not entitled to bring a facial First Amend-<br>

ment challenge to the EAR, and the district court improperly<br>

granted an injunction on the basis of a facial challenge. I<br>

therefore respectfully dissent.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The basic error which sets the majority and the district<br>

court adrift is the failure to fully recognize that the basic
func-<br>

tion of encryption source code is to act as a method of con-<br>

trolling computers. As defined in the EAR regulations,<br>

encryption source code is "[a] precise set of operating instruc-<br>

tions to a computer, that when compiled, allows for the execu-<br>

tion of an encryption function on a computer." 15 C.F.R. pt.<br>

722. Software engineers generally do not create software in<br>

object code--the series of binary digits (1's and 0's)--which<br>

tells a computer what to do because it would be enormously</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4246<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>difficult, cumbersome and time-consuming. Instead, software<br>

engineers use high-level computer programming languages<br>

such as "C" or "Basic" to create source code as a shorthand<br>

method for telling the computer to perform a desired function.<br>

In this respect, lines of source code are the building blocks or<br>

the tools used to create an encryption machine. See e.g., Pat-<br>

rick Ian Ross, Bernstein v. United States Department of State,<br>

13 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 405, 410-11 (1998) ("[E]lectronic<br>

source code that is ready to compile merely needs a few<br>

keystrokes to generate object code--the equivalent of flipping<br>

an `on' switch. Code used for this purpose can fairly easily be<br>

characterized as `essentially functional.' "); Pamela Samuel-<br>

son et al., A Manifesto Concerning Legal Protection of Com-<br>

puter Programs, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 2308, 2315-30 (1994)<br>

("[P]rograms are, in fact, machines (entities that bring about<br>

useful results, i.e., behavior) that have been constructed in the<br>

medium of text (source code and object code)."). Encryption</tt><br>

<tt>source code, once compiled, works to make computer com-<br>

munication and transactions secret; it creates a lockbox of<br>

sorts around a message that can only be unlocked by someone<br>

with a key. It is the function or task that encryption source<br>

code performs which creates its value in most cases. This<br>

functional aspect of encryption source code contains no<br>

expression; it is merely the tool used to build the encryption<br>

machine.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>This is not to say that this very same source code is not<br>

used expressively in some cases. Academics, such as Bern-<br>

stein, seek to convey and discuss their ideas concerning com-<br>

puter encryption. As noted by the majority, Bernstein must<br>

actually use his source code textually in order to discuss or<br>

teach cryptology. In such circumstances, source code serves<br>

to express Bernstein's scientific methods and ideas.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>While it is conceptually difficult to categorize encryption<br>

source code under our First Amendment framework, I am still<br>

inevitably led to conclude that encryption source code is more<br>

like conduct than speech. Encryption source code is a
building</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4247<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>tool. Academics and computer programmers can convey this<br>

source code to each other in order to reveal the encryption<br>

machine they have built. But, the ultimate purpose of encryp-<br>

tion code is, as its name suggests, to perform the function of<br>

encrypting messages. Thus, while encryption source code<br>

may occasionally be used in an expressive manner, it is inher-<br>

ently a functional device.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>We are not the first to examine the nature of encryption<br>

source code in terms of First Amendment protection. Judge<br>

Gwin of the United States District Court for the Northern Dis-<br>

trict of Ohio also explored the function versus expression<br>

conundrum of encryption source code at some length in<br>

Junger v. Daley, 8 F. Supp. 2d 708 (N.D. Ohio 1998). Junger,<br>

like Bernstein, is a professor, albeit a law professor, who<br>

wished to publish in various forms his work on computers,<br>

including a textbook, Computers and the Law. The book was<br>

determined by the Government to be subject to export without<br>

a license, but his software programs were determined to come<br>

within the licensing provisions of the EAR. In the course of<br>

rejecting Junger's claims, the court said:</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like much computer software, encryption
source<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; code is inherently functional; it is designed to
enable<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a computer to do a designated task.
Encryption<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source code does not merely explain a
cryptographic<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; theory or describe how the software functions.
More<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than describing encryption, the software carries
out<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the function of encryption. The software is
essential<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to carry out the function of encryption. In
doing this<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; function, the encryption software is
indistinguishable<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from dedicated computer hardware that does
encryp-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tion.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the overwhelming majority of
circumstances,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encryption source code is exported to transfer
func-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tions, not to communicate ideas. In exporting
func-<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tioning capability, encryption source code is
like</tt><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4248<br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other encryption devices. For the broad
majority of<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; persons receiving such source code, the value
comes<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the function the source code does.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Id. at 716. The Junger decision thus adds considerable sup-<br>

port for the propositions that encryption source code cannot<br>

be categorized as pure speech and that the functional aspects<br>

of encryption source code cannot be easily ignored or put<br>

aside.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Both the district court and the majority hold that because<br>

source code can be used expressively in some circumstances,<br>

Bernstein was entitled to bring a facial challenge to the EAR.<br>

Such an approach ignores the basic tenet that facial challenges<br>

are inappropriate "unless, at a minimum, the challenged stat-<br>

ute `is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or con-<br>

duct commonly associated with expression.' " Roulette v. City<br>

of Seattle, 97 F.3d 300, 305 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting City of<br>

Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750, 760<br>

(1988)). That encryption source code may on occasion be<br>

used expressively does not mean that its export is "conduct<br>

commonly associated with expression" or that the EAR regu-<br>

lations are directed at expressive conduct. See id. at 303 ("The<br>

fact that sitting can possibly be expressive, however, isn't<br>

enough to sustain plaintiffs' facial challenge."); see also<br>

Junger, 8 F. Supp. 2d at 718 ("[T]he prior restraint doctrine<br>

is not implicated simply because an activity may on occasion</tt><br>

<tt>be expressive.").</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>The activity or conduct at issue here is the export of<br>

encryption source code. As I noted above, the basic nature of<br>

encryption source code lies in its functional capacity as a<br>

method to build an encryption device. Export of encryption<br>

source code is not conduct commonly associated with expres-<br>

sion. Rather, it is conduct that is normally associated with<br>

providing other persons with the means to make their com-<br>

puter messages secret. The overwhelming majority of people<br>

do not want to talk about the source code and are not inter-</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4249<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>ested in any recondite message that may be contained in<br>

encryption source code. Only a few people can actually<br>

understand what a line of source code would direct a com-<br>

puter to do. Most people simply want to use the encryption<br>

source code to protect their computer communications. Export<br>

of encryption source code simply does not fall within the<br>

bounds of conduct commonly associated with expression such<br>

as picketing or handbilling. See Roulette, 97 F.3d at
303-04.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Further, the EAR regulates the export of encryption tech-<br>

nology generally, whether it is software or hardware. See 15<br>

C.F.R. S 742.15; Junger, 8 F. Supp. 2d at 718 ("The Export<br>

Regulations do not single out encryption software."). These<br>

regulations are directed at preventing the functional capacity<br>

of any encryption device, including its source code, from<br>

being exported without a government license. The EAR is not<br>

specifically directed towards stifling the expressive nature of<br>

source code or Bernstein's academic discussions about cryp-<br>

tography. This is demonstrated by the fact that the regulations<br>

do not object to publication in printed form of learned articles<br>

containing source code. See 15 C.F.R. S 734.3. Thus, the EAR<br>

is generally directed at non-expressive conduct--the export of<br>

source code as a tool to make messages secret and impervious<br>

to government eavesdropping capabilities.</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>Because this is a law of general application focused at con-<br>

duct, Bernstein is not entitled to bring a facial challenge. The<br>

district court's injunction based upon the finding of a facial<br>

prior restraint is thus impermissible. This is not to say that<br>

Bernstein's activities would not be entitled to First Amend-<br>

ment protection, but that the legal path chosen to get that pro-<br>

tection must be the correct one. We should be careful to<br>

"entertain[ ] facial freedom-of-expression challenges only<br>

against statutes that, `by their terms,' sought to regulate `spo-<br>

ken words,' or patently `expressive or communicative<br>

conduct.' " Roulette, 97 F.3d at 303 (citing Broadrick v.<br>

Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612-13 (1973)). Bernstein may very<br>

well have a claim under an as-applied First Amendment anal-</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4250<br>

</tt><br>

<br>

<tt>ysis; however, such a claim must be left to the district
court's<br>

determination in the first instance. Here, the district court did<br>

not rule on Bernstein's as-applied claims. I would therefore<br>

vacate the district court's injunction and remand for consider-<br>

ation of Bernstein's as-applied challenges to the EAR.<br>

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</tt><br>
